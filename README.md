# Thinky

üëâ **[Open Thinky](https://bacionejs.github.io/stuff/thinky.html)**

## Purpose  

Find *who* uses *what*, i.e. repos using sonant, zzfx, etc.

Thinky searches code of the js13kgames competitions. It is designed mainly for newbies who are looking for examples of using various techniques. For example, you go to js13kgames resource page and you see the Sonant music library and decide that it might fit your needs, but you don't know where to find examples of the devs using it. That is where Thinky comes in, just type `sonant` into the filter and click on a listed repository.

## üí° Features

- üîç **Live filtering** of tokens as you type.
- üß† **Case-aware search** (preserves meaning of uppercase input).
- üì¶ **Compact index** format (`thinky.json`) for fast loading.
- üìÅ **Click-to-open** any matched repo on GitHub.
- üö´ **Removes junk like base64 blobs** to keep token index clean.

---

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Open `thinky.html` in your browser.
2. Start typing a token prefix into the filter box.
3. Matching tokens and repositories will appear instantly.
4. Click any repository name to view it on GitHub.

# Game Explorer

This is a **browser-based viewer** for exploring the contents of `games.json` (generated by `games.mjs`). It lets you group, filter, and browse JS13K game entries by year or author ‚Äî all directly from a static webpage.

## üåê Try It Now

üëâ **[Open the Viewer](https://bacionejs.github.io/stuff/games.html)**

## üîç What It Does

- Loads `games.json` dynamically in the browser
- Offers three built-in queries:
  - **Group by Author** ‚Äì Shows all games organized by contributor
  - **Group by Year** ‚Äì Groups games by release year
  - **Count by Year** ‚Äì Shows a count of games per year, with clickable links to drill down into either view (by year or by author)
- Includes a **filter box** to search within results in real time
- Adds a **scroll-to-top button** for easy navigation on long pages


## üí° Notes

- The **Group by Author** query uses `parent` as the author, if available, otherwise extracts the word after the last occurrence of *by* in the `description`, otherwise categorized as *unknown*. The parent field is not reliable for extracting author information because participants might delete their repositories.

- The **Group by Year** query includes the full `description`.

- All three queries need the **year**. It is the first year in the `description` that is not found in the name, unless there are no other, otherwise it uses `created_at`, which isn't accurate because some old games got forked in the year of the cat.


## üì¶ Repository Scraper: `games.mjs`
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** These are not usage instructions ‚Äî this is just how I generate the JSON file...maybe once a day during the August/September competition.

This script fetches metadata for all **public repositories** in the [js13kGames](https://github.com/js13kGames) GitHub organization and saves a simplified log (`games.json`) with just the essential fields.

### üîß Features

- Uses the GitHub API via [`@octokit/rest`](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js)
- Handles pagination and rate limits automatically
- Runs multiple requests in parallel using [`p-limit`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-limit)
- Extracts only key metadata into clean, lightweight JSON

### üß∞ Installation

Install dependencies using NPM:

```bash
npm install @octokit/rest p-limit
```

Required libraries:

- **`@octokit/rest`** ‚Äì GitHub API client library  
- **`p-limit`** ‚Äì Limits the number of concurrent API calls to avoid throttling

### üóÇÔ∏è Output Format (`games.json`)

Each repository is logged with fields like:

```json
{
  "name": "repo-name",
  "full_name": "js13kGames/repo-name",
  "owner": "js13kGames",
  "description": "Game description",
  "homepage": "https://game.example.com",
  "created_at": "2023-09-13T12:34:56Z",
  "size": 1234,
  "html_url": "https://github.com/js13kGames/repo-name",
  "parent": "original-author/repo-name",
  "source": "original-author/repo-name",
  "organization": "js13kGames"
}
```

### üöÄ Usage

1. **Set your GitHub token** (to increase rate limits):
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   node games.mjs
   ```

3. The output will be saved to `games.json`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Inside the script:

- `LIMIT = 0`: Fetches **all** repositories (recommended for full runs).  
- `LIMIT = 10`: Recommended for **testing**, to avoid hitting the GitHub rate limit.  
- `MAX_PARALLEL = 10`: Controls how many requests run concurrently.  
  This is set to **10** to stay under GitHub‚Äôs **approx. 10 requests per second** soft limit.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub Rate Limits

- GitHub‚Äôs authenticated API allows **5,000 requests per day**.
- The `js13kGames` organization has **over 2,000 repositories**, and each one requires an individual API call.
- You can typically run the full script **only once or twice per day** before hitting the daily limit.
- Without a token, the unauthenticated limit is just **60 requests per hour**.
